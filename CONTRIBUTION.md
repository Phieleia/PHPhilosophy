# Contribution Guide

Thank you for being interested in contributing to this project. :) Before getting started, please read the following guide.

FIRST: Please note that this framework is developed especially for beginners to the PHP language or people that just want a simple tool with a small footprint. Because of the increasing complexity of existing frameworks the requirements one must fullfil before getting started become higher and higher. Also most frameworks require the use of Composer and are build upon many third-party libraries. Whilst this project shall not forbid the use of these tools and libraries, it shouldn't enforce the user to utilize anything else than PHP itself.
